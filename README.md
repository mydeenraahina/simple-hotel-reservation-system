Hotel Reservation Project



Description


This is a simple Python program for managing hotel room reservations. It allows users to check room availability, book rooms, and cancel bookings. The program is designed to simulate a hotel reservation system for a hotel with two floors and a total number of rooms specified for each floor.

Room Availability Checking: Users can view the total number of rooms available on each floor and the number of rooms already booked.


Room Booking: Users can book rooms by specifying the floor, number of rooms required, room capacity (single, double, or triple), and the purpose of the booking.


Booking Cancellation: Users can cancel their room bookings by providing a reason for cancellation.


User-friendly Menu Interface: The program provides a simple menu interface for users to navigate through different options.
